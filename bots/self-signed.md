# Using self-signed certificates

Upload your certificate using the certificate parameter in the setWebhook method. The certificate supplied should be PEM encoded (ASCII BASE64), the pem file should only contain the public key (including BEGIN and END portions). When converting from a bundle format, please split the file to only include the public key.

### Generating a self-signed certificate pair (PEM):

#### Openssl

> Windows binaries for Openssl are available online

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout YOURPRIVATE.key -x509 -days 365 -out YOURPUBLIC.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=Brooklyn/O=Example Brooklyn Company/CN=YOURDOMAIN.EXAMPLE"

YOURPUBLIC.pem has to be used as input for setting the self-signed webhook.

You can inspect the generated certificate with:openssl x509 -text -noout -in YOURPUBLIC.pem

Converting from a previously generated DER:openssl x509 -inform der -in YOURDER.der -out YOURPEM.pem

Converting from a previously generated PKCS12:openssl pkcs12 -in YOURPKCS.p12 -out YOURPEM.pem

#### Java keystore

Generate self-signed JKS:keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias YOURDOMAIN.EXAMPLE -keystore YOURJKS.jks -storepass YOURPASSWORD -validity 360 -keysize 2048

Converting JKS to pkcs12 (intermediate step for conversion to PEM):keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore YOURJKS.jks -destkeystore YOURPKCS.p12 -srcstoretype jks -deststoretype pkcs12

Convert PKCS12 to PEM (requires openssl):openssl pkcs12 -in YOURPKCS.p12 -out YOURPEM.pem

#### Windows

Creating a self-signed certificate using Windows native utilities is also possible, although OpenSSL binaries for Windows are available online.

On the commandline:certreq -new TEMPLATE.txt RequestFileOut

TEMPLATE.txt example file:

A self-signed certificate will be generated and installed, to view the certificate:certutil -store -user my

To export in DER format (intermediate step for conversion to PEM)certutil -user -store -split my SERIALNUMBER YOURDER.crt

Converting to PEM (used for setting the webhook)certutil -encode YOURDER.crt YOURPEM.cer

To delete a certificate from your store:certutil -delstore -user my SERIALNUMBER (from view)

To export in PFX(PKCS12) formatcertutil -exportpfx -user YOURDOMAIN.EXAMPLE YOURPKCS.pfx NoChain

> More information: https://technet.microsoft.com

Converting YOURPKCS.pfx to PEM including the private key is best done with OpenSSL:openssl pkcs12 -in YOURPKCS.pfx -out YOURPEM.cer

Remember that only the public key is needed as input for the self-signed webhook certificate parameter. certmgr.msc can also be used as a GUI to export the public part of self-signed certificates to PEM.

### Authorizing your bot

Each bot is given a unique authentication token when it is created. The token looks something like 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11, but we'll use simply <token> in this document instead. You can learn about obtaining tokens and generating new ones in this document.

### Making requests

All queries to the Telegram Bot API must be served over HTTPS and need to be presented in this form: https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/METHOD_NAME. Like this for example:

We support GET and POST HTTP methods. We support four ways of passing parameters in Bot API requests:

- URL query string

- application/x-www-form-urlencoded

- application/json (except for uploading files)

- multipart/form-data (use to upload files)

The response contains a JSON object, which always has a Boolean field 'ok' and may have an optional String field 'description' with a human-readable description of the result. If 'ok' equals True, the request was successful and the result of the query can be found in the 'result' field. In case of an unsuccessful request, 'ok' equals false and the error is explained in the 'description'. An Integer 'error_code' field is also returned, but its contents are subject to change in the future. Some errors may also have an optional field 'parameters' of the type ResponseParameters, which can help to automatically handle the error.

- All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive.

- All queries must be made using UTF-8.

#### Making requests when getting updates

If you're using webhooks, you can perform a request to the Bot API while sending an answer to the webhook. Use either application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data response content type for passing parameters. Specify the method to be invoked in the method parameter of the request. It's not possible to know that such a request was successful or get its result.

> Please see our FAQ for examples.

### Using a Local Bot API Server

The Bot API server source code is available at telegram-bot-api. You can run it locally and send the requests to your own server instead of https://api.telegram.org. If you switch to a local Bot API server, your bot will be able to:

- Download files without a size limit.

- Upload files up to 2000 MB.

- Upload files using their local path and the file URI scheme.

- Use an HTTP URL for the webhook.

- Use any local IP address for the webhook.

- Use any port for the webhook.

- Set max_webhook_connections up to 100000.

- Receive the absolute local path as a value of the file_path field without the need to download the file after a getFile request.

#### Do I need a Local Bot API Server

The majority of bots will be OK with the default configuration, running on our servers. But if you feel that you need one of these features, you're welcome to switch to your own at any time.

### Getting updates

There are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for your bot - the getUpdates method on one hand and webhooks on the other. Incoming updates are stored on the server until the bot receives them either way, but they will not be kept longer than 24 hours.

Regardless of which option you choose, you will receive JSON-serialized Update objects as a result.

#### Update

This object represents an incoming update.
At most one of the optional parameters can be present in any given update.

#### getUpdates

Use this method to receive incoming updates using long polling (wiki). Returns an Array of Update objects.

> Notes
1. This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up.
2. In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate offset after each server response.

#### setWebhook

Use this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL, containing a JSON-serialized Update. In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns True on success.

If you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter secret_token. If specified, the request will contain a header "X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token" with the secret token as content.

> Notes
1. You will not be able to receive updates using getUpdates for as long as an outgoing webhook is set up.
2. To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your public key certificate using certificate parameter. Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work.
3. Ports currently supported for webhooks: 443, 80, 88, 8443.

> If you're having any trouble setting up webhooks, please check out this amazing guide to webhooks.

#### deleteWebhook

Use this method to remove webhook integration if you decide to switch back to getUpdates. Returns True on success.

#### getWebhookInfo

Use this method to get current webhook status. Requires no parameters. On success, returns a WebhookInfo object. If the bot is using getUpdates, will return an object with the url field empty.

#### WebhookInfo

Describes the current status of a webhook.

### Available types

All types used in the Bot API responses are represented as JSON-objects.

It is safe to use 32-bit signed integers for storing all Integer fields unless otherwise noted.

> Sample bot: @discussbot

#### SwitchInlineQueryChosenChat

This object represents an inline button that switches the current user to inline mode in a chosen chat, with an optional default inline query.

#### CallbackQuery

This object represents an incoming callback query from a callback button in an inline keyboard. If the button that originated the query was attached to a message sent by the bot, the field message will be present. If the button was attached to a message sent via the bot (in inline mode), the field inline_message_id will be present. Exactly one of the fields data or game_short_name will be present.

> NOTE: After the user presses a callback button, Telegram clients will display a progress bar until you call answerCallbackQuery. It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling answerCallbackQuery even if no notification to the user is needed (e.g., without specifying any of the optional parameters).

#### ForceReply

Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice privacy mode.

> Example: A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:

Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'.

The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.

- It is not possible to change the file type when resending by file_id. I.e. a video can't be sent as a photo, a photo can't be sent as a document, etc.

- It is not possible to resend thumbnails.

- Resending a photo by file_id will send all of its sizes.

- file_id is unique for each individual bot and can't be transferred from one bot to another.

- file_id uniquely identifies a file, but a file can have different valid file_ids even for the same bot.

Sending by URL

- When sending by URL the target file must have the correct MIME type (e.g., audio/mpeg for sendAudio, etc.).

- In sendDocument, sending by URL will currently only work for GIF, PDF and ZIP files.

- To use sendVoice, the file must have the type audio/ogg and be no more than 1MB in size. 1-20MB voice notes will be sent as files.

- Other configurations may work but we can't guarantee that they will.

#### Accent colors

#### Inline mode objects

Objects and methods used in the inline mode are described in the Inline mode section.

### Available methods

> All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive. We support GET and POST HTTP methods. Use either URL query string or application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data for passing parameters in Bot API requests.
On successful call, a JSON-object containing the result will be returned.

#### getMe

A simple method for testing your bot's authentication token. Requires no parameters. Returns basic information about the bot in form of a User object.

#### logOut

Use this method to log out from the cloud Bot API server before launching the bot locally. You must log out the bot before running it locally, otherwise there is no guarantee that the bot will receive updates. After a successful call, you can immediately log in on a local server, but will not be able to log in back to the cloud Bot API server for 10 minutes. Returns True on success. Requires no parameters.

#### close

Use this method to close the bot instance before moving it from one local server to another. You need to delete the webhook before calling this method to ensure that the bot isn't launched again after server restart. The method will return error 429 in the first 10 minutes after the bot is launched. Returns True on success. Requires no parameters.

#### sendMessage

Use this method to send text messages. On success, the sent Message is returned.

#### Formatting options

The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, spoiler text, block quotations as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can specify text entities directly, or use markdown-style or HTML-style formatting.

Note that Telegram clients will display an alert to the user before opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL).

Message entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met:

- If two entities have common characters, then one of them is fully contained inside another.

- bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and spoiler entities can contain and can be part of any other entities, except pre and code.

- blockquote entities can't be nested.

- All other entities can't contain each other.

Links tg://user?id=<user_id> can be used to mention a user by their identifier without using a username. Please note:

- These links will work only if they are used inside an inline link or in an inline keyboard button. For example, they will not work, when used in a message text.

- Unless the user is a member of the chat where they were mentioned, these mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in private in the past or has sent a callback query to the bot via an inline button and doesn't have Forwarded Messages privacy enabled for the bot.

You can find the list of programming and markup languages for which syntax highlighting is supported at libprisma#supported-languages.

###### MarkdownV2 style

To use this mode, pass MarkdownV2 in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:

Please note:

- Any character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.

- Inside pre and code entities, all '`' and '\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.

- Inside the (...) part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\' must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.

- In all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\'.

- In case of ambiguity between italic and underline entities __ is always greadily treated from left to right as beginning or end of underline entity, so instead of ___italic underline___ use ___italic underline_\r__, where \r is a character with code 13, which will be ignored.

- A valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.

- Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.

###### HTML style

To use this mode, pass HTML in the parse_mode field. The following tags are currently supported:

Please note:

- Only the tags mentioned above are currently supported.

- All <, > and & symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< with &lt;, > with &gt; and & with &amp;).

- All numerical HTML entities are supported.

- The API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and &quot;.

- Use nested pre and code tags, to define programming language for pre entity.

- Programming language can't be specified for standalone code tags.

- A valid emoji must be used as the content of the tg-emoji tag. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.

- Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.

###### Markdown style

This is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this mode, pass Markdown in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:

Please note:

- Entities must not be nested, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.

- There is no way to specify "underline", "strikethrough", "spoiler", "blockquote" and "custom_emoji" entities, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.

- To escape characters '_', '*', '`', '[' outside of an entity, prepend the characters '\' before them.

- Escaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use _snake_\__case_ for italic snake_case and *2*\**2=4* for bold 2*2=4.

> Example: The ImageBot needs some time to process a request and upload the image. Instead of sending a text message along the lines of "Retrieving image, please wait...", the bot may use sendChatAction with action = upload_photo. The user will see a "sending photo" status for the bot.

We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a noticeable amount of time to arrive.

### Games

Your bot can offer users HTML5 games to play solo or to compete against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Create games via @BotFather using the /newgame command. Please note that this kind of power requires responsibility: you will need to accept the terms for each game that your bots will be offering.

- Games are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the Game and InlineQueryResultGame objects.

- Once you've created a game via BotFather, you can send games to chats as regular messages using the sendGame method, or use inline mode with InlineQueryResultGame.

- If you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play GameName' button. When this button is pressed, your bot gets a CallbackQuery with the game_short_name of the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app opens the game in the in-app browser.

- You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row must always launch the game, using the field callback_game in InlineKeyboardButton. You can add extra buttons according to taste: e.g., for a description of the rules, or to open the game's official community.

- To make your game more attractive, you can upload a GIF animation that demostrates the game to the users via BotFather (see Lumberjack for example).

- A game message will also display high scores for the current chat. Use setGameScore to post high scores to the chat with the game, add the edit_message parameter to automatically update the message with the current scoreboard.

- Use getGameHighScores to get data for in-game high score tables.

- You can also add an extra sharing button for users to share their best score to different chats.

- For examples of what can be done using this new stuff, check the @gamebot and @gamee bots.

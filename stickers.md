#### Creating Animations

To create vector-animated stickers and emoji you will need the following:

- Animation length must not exceed 3 seconds.

#### Uploading Animations

When your files are ready, send the /newanimated command to the @Stickers bot – then send it the .TGS files.

### Using the @Stickers Bot

Publishing and editing sticker packs is simple and automated, thanks to the @Stickers bot. It can also show you detailed stats for stickers and packs.

#### Publishing a Sticker Pack

Once you open the bot, press the Start button or send /start. The bot will reply, describing its different commands. It will walk you through step by step, but here's a quick guide:

- Open the bot menu in the message bar and select the /newpack command to start uploading static stickers. For animated stickers use /newanimated, or /newvideo for video stickers.

- Give your sticker pack a name – this name will appear as the title for your pack in the sticker panel.

- Send your first sticker file – an image file, .TGS file, or .WEBM file. Using one of the Desktop or Web apps is strongly recommended.

- Choose an emoji that corresponds to your sticker – this lets users quickly find it with sticker suggestions.

- Continue uploading all your sticker files.

- When you're done uploading, send the /publish command.

- Set an icon for your pack – static sticker packs can /skip this step, but it is required for animated or video stickers.

- Choose a short name for your sticker pack – it will be used to create a shareable link for the pack like t.me/addstickers/HotCherry. Congratulations! Your stickers are ready for the world.

> After your pack is finished, you can send /start again to see the full list of commands, or use the bot menu to create another pack, edit an existing pack, or see statistics.

#### Editing a Sticker Pack

Once you've created one or more packs, you can add, edit or replace stickers in your existing sets.

- Use /addsticker if you have more artwork you'd like to add to a set. Choose one of your packs from the list – the upload process is exactly the same as before.

- Use /editsticker to change the emoji you assigned to a sticker – select the pack and sticker, or simply send the intended sticker from your panel.

- Use /replacesticker if you want to swap out an older sticker for an updated version.

- Use /ordersticker to change the order of stickers in your pack. Choose the pack and one of the stickers, then choose another sticker to appear before it (to the left) in the panel.

- Use /delsticker to remove a sticker from the pack – you can always use /addsticker to add it again if you change your mind.

- Use /seticon to set an icon for your pack or to change the icon. Static sticker packs without a custom icon will use the first sticker as its icon.

> Edits to your sticker packs may take up to an hour to update for all users.

#### Sticker Stats

There are a number of commands that let you see statistics for your stickers – here's what they all do:

- /packstats shows how many times your pack was used, installed and removed – both recently and overall.

- /stats shows how many times an individual sticker has been sent.

- /top shows the most popular stickers from all your packs.

- /packtop shows your most popular sticker packs and their individual stats.

- /topbypack shows the top stickers from a specific sticker pack.

- /packusagetop shows your most popular packs by recent usage.

> You can filter the results of /top, /packtop, /topbypack and /packusagetop. For example /top 20 would show your top 20 stickers, and /topbypack -5 would show the 5 least popular stickers from a pack.

### Importing Stickers From Other Apps

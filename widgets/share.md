# Sharing Button
When a user presses the button, Telegram asks them to choose a chat, group or channel where your link will be shared. You can also add some text that describes the link â€“ the user will be able to edit it before sending the message.

#### Custom buttons
Feel free to create your own custom UI for the button. The only thing you need to make it work is to point the user to this URL on click:
where {url} is the URL the user will be sharing and {text} is an optional description that will be included with the link. Both values should be URL-encoded.
Here is a sample code for PHP:
You are welcome to use the Telegram Logos in your custom button design.

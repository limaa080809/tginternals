## Parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | :----: | ----------- |
| flags | # | Flags, see TL conditional fields |
| single_use | flags.1?true | Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat â€“ the user can press a special button in the input field to see the custom keyboard again. |
| selective | flags.2?true | Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message. Example: A user requests to change the bot's language, bot replies to the request with a keyboard to select the new language. Other users in the group don't see the keyboard. |
| placeholder | flags.3?string | The placeholder to be shown in the input field when the keyboard is active; 1-64 characters. |

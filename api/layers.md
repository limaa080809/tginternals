To view all the changes since the last update, start reading the changelog @ Layer 146.
Most importantly, layer 152 added support for Firebase SMS authentication, which in some conditions may be required by the server in order to send SMS codes.
Currently, only official apps can make use of Firebase SMS authentication: this means that in some conditions, only the official applications can receive a login/signup code via SMS/call.
Third-party apps may log in using any of the other code delivery methods (Telegram codes, Fragment codes, email codes, future auth tokens, QR codes).
And now, here are the changes made in this layer:
You can now share folders », use collectible usernames for bots », set custom per-chat wallpapers » and reset the login email ».
Users may now edit the usernames, name, about text, description and profile picture of bots they own using the API.

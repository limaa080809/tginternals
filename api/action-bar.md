# Action bar
Sometimes, when interacting with Telegram users via private or secret chats, an action bar must be shown on top of the chat, offering convenient action buttons or notices regarding the user.
Schema:
The action bar is represented by the peerSettings constructor, fetchable using messages.getPeerSettings; it is also contained in the userFull constructor returned by users.getFullUser.
Changes to the chat bar may also be notified by the server using updatePeerSettings.
The currently active action bar may also be dismissed using messages.hidePeerSettingsBar.
What follows is a list of the various (mutually exclusive) chat bar types, along with the condition used to identify each type, by checking the appropriate flags of peerSettings.
### Report spam, block or add contact
This action bar, associated to a private or secret chat, offers the user buttons to:

- If the other user has an emoji status, then the bar should also show a notice, indicating that the emoji status is shown next to the user's name because they have purchased Telegram Premium (i.e. this is useful to avoid issues if the user uses an emoji status similar to a verified checkmark).
- Additionally, if the chat was automatically archived » (according to peerSettings.autoarchived), an extra button can be shown to unarchive the chat as specified here » instead of reporting it.

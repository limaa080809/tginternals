# Client configuration
The MTProto API has multiple configuration parameters that can be fetched with the appropriate methods.
### MTProto configuration
The huge config constructor contains lots of useful information, from chat and message size limitations, to privacy settings, online status refresh interval and timeout, VoIP configuration, default inline bot usernames for GIF, image and venue lookup, and lots of other global and user-specific information, check out the constructor page for more information.
### Client configuration
The help.getAppConfig method returns a JSON object containing rapidly evolving, client-specific configuration parameters.
While help.getConfig returns MTProto-specific configuration with information about server-side limitations and other MTProto-related information, help.getAppConfig returns configuration parameters useful for graphical Telegram clients.
When first invoking help.getAppConfig, pass 0 to hash; in future calls, use the hash contained in the previously returned help.appConfig; if the configuration hasn't changed, a help.appConfigNotModified will be returned instead of help.appConfig.

### Suggestions
The API can return a set of useful suggestions for users of graphical clients.
#### Basic suggestions
The help.getAppConfig method returns a JSON object containing rapidly evolving, client-specific configuration parameters.
A full list of these parameters can be seen in the Client Configuration section », but we're mostly interested in the pending_suggestions and autoarchive_setting_available fields of the returned JSON object:
- autoarchive_setting_available - Whether clients can invoke account.setGlobalPrivacySettings with globalPrivacySettings.archive_and_mute_new_noncontact_peers = boolTrue, to automatically archive and mute new incoming chats from non-contacts. (boolean)
- pending_suggestions - Contains a list of suggestions that should be actively shown as a tooltip to the user. Array of strings, possible values shown below:

- "VALIDATE_PASSWORD" - Users should make sure they still remember their 2-step verification password.
- "VALIDATE_PHONE_NUMBER" - Users should check whether their authorization phone number is correct and change the phone number if it is inaccessible.
- "NEWCOMER_TICKS" - Show the user a hint about the meaning of one and two ticks on sent messages.
- "SETUP_PASSWORD" - Show the user a hint, asking them to check whether they still remember their 2FA password
- "PREMIUM_ANNUAL" - Suggests the user to subscribe to the Premium subscription (with annual payments)
- "PREMIUM_UPGRADE" - Suggests the user to upgrade their existing Premium subscription from monthly payments to annual payments
- "PREMIUM_RESTORE" - Suggests the user to restore a recently expired Premium subscription
#### Channel suggestions

Here's a list of possible suggestions:
- CONVERT_GIGAGROUP - The supergroup has many participants: the admin should call channels.convertToGigagroup to convert it to a gigagroup.
#### Dismissing suggestions
help.dismissSuggestion can be used to dismiss a suggestion.
Pass inputPeerEmpty to peer for basic suggestions and the channel/supergroup's peer for channel suggestions.
### App-specific configuration
- help.getAppUpdate - Get info about an application update, can contain the updated application binary in the attached document
- help.getInviteText - Returns a localized invitation message that can be sent via SMS to contacts that haven't signed up to Telegram yet
### Terms of service
These methods can be used for managing consent to Telegram's Terms Of Service.
Typically, before a user signs up by invoking auth.signUp, apps should show a pop-up (if the popup flag of the help.termsOfService method is set), asking the user to accept Telegram's terms of service; in case of denial, the user is to be returned to the initial page of the login flow.
When signing up for the first time, the help.termsOfService is to be obtained from the auth.authorizationSignUpRequired constructor returned by the auth.signIn.
After signing up, or when logging in as an existing user, apps are supposed to call help.getTermsOfServiceUpdate to check for any updates to the Terms of Service; this call should be repeated after expires seconds have elapsed.
If an update to the Terms Of Service is available, clients are supposed to show a consent popup; if accepted, clients should call help.acceptTermsOfService, providing the termsOfService id JSON object; in case of denial, clients are to delete the account using account.deleteAccount, providing Decline ToS update as deletion reason.
Example implementation: android (signup), android (after login)
### Telegram support info
These methods can be used for fetching info about Telegram's support user, that users can use to get support and ask questions about the app.
- help.getSupport - Will return the user object that can be used for contacting support.
- help.getSupportName - Will return a localized name for the support chat.
### Country information and login phone patterns
help.getCountriesList can be used to fetch a list of localized names for all available countries and phone code patterns for logging in.
The phone code pattern should be used when showing the login screen, or when changing phone number: for example, a pattern value of XXX XXX XXX with country_code +39 indicates that the phone field for login should accept a spaced pattern like +39 123 456 789.
Also, the beginning of the national part of the phone number (123 456 789) should match one of the prefixes, if any were returned.
Additionally, the fragment_prefixes client configuration parameter contains a list of phone number prefixes for anonymous Fragment phone numbers.

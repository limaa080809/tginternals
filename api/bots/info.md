# Edit bot information

Users can edit and localize the profile picture, name, about text and description of bots they own; the same can be done by the bots themselves.

Bots may invoke bots.setBotInfo set a localized version of their name, about text and description; bots.getBotInfo may be used to obtain previously set values.
Bots may also invoke photos.uploadProfilePhoto as specified in the files documentation Â» to set profile photos, videos or stickers.

The same methods may be invoked by the user that owns the bot (bots owned by the current user have the user.bot_can_edit flag set) to modify the bot's information: to do so, specify the bot's peer information in the bot parameter.

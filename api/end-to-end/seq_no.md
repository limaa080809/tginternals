# Sequence numbers in Secret Chats

It is necessary to interpret all messages in their original order to protect against reordering, reflection, replay, omission and other manipulations (decryptedMessageActionResend messages are the only exception to this rule, see avoiding concurrent gaps). Secret chats support a special mechanism for handling seq_no counters independently from the server. Note that any service messages in secret chats must also increment the seq_no.

All Secret Chats messages in clients using Layer 17 or higher are wrapped in decryptedMessageLayer and have seq_no (sequence number) counters attached to them. The seq_no counters in their raw form are initialized with (out_seq_no, in_seq_no) := (0,0), and incremented strictly by 1 after any message (service or not) is sent/received and processed. They must be protected from mirroring before being sent to the remote client by transformation according to formula 2*raw_seq_no+x, where x is 0 or 1, determined by the following rule:

In this way the least significant bit of each seq_no field included in the message is different for incoming and outgoing messages. This is done to prevent a possible attacker from mirroring the messages. If any of the received in_seq_no or out_seq_no are not consistent in terms of parity (see table above), the client is required to immediately abort the secret chat.

> E.g., the first message the local client sends to any secret chat will have out_seq_no of 0+x_out, the second one will have out_seq_no of 2*1+x_out, and so on, where x_out is 0 if the chat was initiated by the remote client, 1 otherwise; similarly for the received messages, but there x_in is used instead of x_out and is equal to 0 if the chat was initiated by the local client, 1 otherwise.

Raw sequence numbers will be used in the remaining part of this text, unless otherwise specified.

#### Preventing gaps

Your client must ensure that all outgoing secret chat messages are queued on the server in the correct order. This is achieved by correctly placing them into the invokeAfterMsgs chain. Failure to do this may result in gaps on the remote client, which may in turn lead to aborted secret chats. The local client must maintain the correct sequence of in_seq_no for the remote client. To achieve this, assign in_seq_no and out_seq_no to each message at the exact moment when the message is created, and never change them in the future.

#### Checking out_seq_no

Your client must check that it has received each message with the sequence number out_seq_no starting from 0 to some current point C. It should then expect the next message to have the sequence number out_seq_no=C+1. If the out_seq_no in the received message does not match this, the following needs to be done:

- If the received out_seq_no<=C, the local client must drop the message (repeated message). The client should not check the contents of the message because the original message could have been deleted (see Deleting unacknowledged messages).

- If the received out_seq_no>C+1, it most likely means that the server left out some messages due to a technical failure or due to the messages becoming obsolete. A temporary solution to this is to simply abort the secret chat. But since this may cause some existing older secret chats to be aborted, it is strongly recommended for the client to properly handle such seq_no gaps. Note that in_seq_no is not increased upon receipt of such a message; it is advanced only after all preceding gaps are filled.

#### Proper handling of gaps

In order to correctly handle incoming messages after a hole has been identified (when received out_seq_no>C+1), it is necessary to put received messages with the wrong seq_no into a "waiting queue" on the local client, and to re-request the missing messages using the special constructor decryptedMessageActionResend. The sequence numbers used in this constructor must be ready for interpretation by the remote client and therefore cannot be in their raw form: you can easily get the necessary start_seq_no by adding 2 to the out_seq_no of the last message before the hole and the end_seq_no by subtracting 2 from the out_seq_no of the received message with the wrong sequence number.

Each hole normally requires only one request to resend messages â€” if the remote client keeps sending out of sync messages, they should be put into the queue without sending a new request. Having received the missing messages, the local client must first interpret these messages in the right order by their seq_no. Once this is done, the client can proceed to interpret messages from the queue (again, in the right seq_no order).

Special cases:

- Note that having two gaps simultaneously is very rare (provided that the remote client and server are operating normally) and it is acceptable to abort the secret chat in this situation.

- If a local client receives decryptedMessageActionResend but is unable to satisfy the request, it must abort the secret chat.

#### Avoiding concurrent gaps

In order to avoid getting stuck with concurrent gaps on both sides, decryptedMessageActionResend must always be interpreted immediately upon receipt in all cases, even if its out_seq_no>=C+1. Note that each decryptedMessageActionResend must only be handled once, it must not be interpreted again when we interpret messages in the queue.

#### Checking and handling in_seq_no

in_seq_no of all received messages must be valid. To ensure this, perform the following checks:

- in_seq_no must form a non-decreasing sequence of non-negative integer numbers.

- in_seq_no must be valid at the moment of receiving the message, that is, if D is the out_seq_no of last message we sent, the received in_seq_no should not be greater than D + 1. This also allows us to insert the received message into its correct place in the secret chat. For example, imagine that the local client has sent 5 secret chat messages, and then receives a secret chat message with the text "Yes" and in_seq_no=2. In this situation the local client must place that message after the second message it sent. This makes manipulations with delayed messages impossible.

If in_seq_no contradicts these criteria, the local client is required to immediately abort the secret chat. This could happen only in case of malicious or buggy behaviour on either server or remote client side.

#### Deleting unacknowledged messages

In case the user on the local client has deleted a message before the server (or the remote client, if decryptedMessageActionResend is handled correctly) could acknowledge the message, for security reasons, you must:

- securely destroy the contents of the message (as in case of any other deleted Secret Chat message);

- change the local copy of the original message to decryptedMessageActionDeleteMessages with random_id equal to its own random_id;

- create a new outgoing message deleting the original message.

This must be done because your client doesn't know whether the remote client really received the message or not. In the case the message was already received, it will be deleted by the second message; otherwise it must arrive as a "self-delete" message to maintain the correct sequence of seq_no.

# Deep links

Telegram clients must handle special tg:// and t.me deep links encountered in messages, link entities and in other apps by registering OS handlers.

Links are generally available in two flavors: t.me HTTPS links and tg: URIs.

t.me link syntax examples:

- t.me/path?query

- http://t.me/path?query

- https://t.me/path?query

Where t.me can also be telegram.me, telegram.dog, and the domain specified in the me_url_prefix field of the global configuration, obtainable using help.getConfig.

tg: link syntax examples:

- tg:path?query

- tg://path?query

The #fragment part is always ignored when parsing Telegram deep links.

Also note that whenever a <username>.t.me link is encountered and <username>:

- Is not equal to:

- www

- Any of the values specified in this list ».

- AND is not a single letter

- AND is a valid username

...it should be treated exactly as a t.me/<username>/ link (generate a t.me/<username>/ link and append the rest of the path (if present) and the query string (if present)).

### Public username links

Note that since a forum topic ID is actually the ID of the service message that created the topic, whenever the client resolves a message link that points to a messageActionTopicCreate service message, it should open the topic, instead.
Also, if the message ID is 1 and the linked-to supergroup is a forum, the "General" topic should be opened instead of the first message of the supergroup.

### Forum topic links

Used to link to a specific forum topic.

The syntax is exactly the same as for message links, because the topic ID is actually the ID of the service message that created the topic, so whenever the client resolves a message link that points to a messageActionTopicCreate service message, it should open the topic, instead.

Also, if the message ID is 1 and the linked-to supergroup is a forum, the "General" topic should be opened instead of the first message of the supergroup.

### Share links

These links should be handled as follows:

- An explanation of why a certain link isn't supported by the app;

And/or an invitation to upgrade to the latest version of the client app to be able to use the link: in this case, the result update_app flag will also be set, and the app should directly link to a store or attempt updating to the latest version.

Example links that can be used for testing:

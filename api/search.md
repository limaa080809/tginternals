# Search

Telegram allows applying detailed message filters while looking for messages in chats.

### Search filters

When using messages.search or messages.searchGlobal, a certain message filter may be applied.
This allows the server to filter messages based on a text query, and even on their type, and this feature is often used by graphical clients to implement features like the chat gallery, chat profile pictures and more.
Available filters:

- inputMessagesFilterPhotos - Returns only photos, used for implementing the chat photo gallery, and when scrolling left or right while viewing a photo

- inputMessagesFilterVideo - Returns only videos, used for implementing the chat video gallery, and when scrolling left or right while viewing a video

- inputMessagesFilterPhotoVideo - Return only videos and photos, used for implementing the chat media gallery

- inputMessagesFilterDocument - Return only videos and photos, used for implementing the chat document gallery

- inputMessagesFilterUrl - Return only messages with links, used for implementing the chat link gallery

- inputMessagesFilterGif - Return only GIFs, used for implementing the chat GIF gallery

- inputMessagesFilterVoice - Return only voice messages, used for implementing the chat voice message gallery, and to consecutively play voice messages in a chat

- inputMessagesFilterMusic - Return only music files, used for implementing the chat music gallery

- inputMessagesFilterChatPhotos - Return only chat photos, used to allow scrolling through the profile picture history of a group

- inputMessagesFilterPhoneCalls - Return only phone calls, used with messages.searchGlobal to implement the call tab, with the phone call history

- inputMessagesFilterRoundVoice - Return only round videos and voice messages, used to consecutively play round videos and voice messages in a chat

- inputMessagesFilterRoundVideo - Return only round videos, used to consecutively play round videos in a chat

- inputMessagesFilterMyMentions - Return only messages mentioning me, can be used to display the mention history or, combined with another filter or query, return only messages that satisfy a certain criteria, and contain a mention.

- inputMessagesFilterGeo - Return only geolocations, is used to fetch all recent valid geolocations or live locations sent in a group, to display them all in a single map

- inputMessagesFilterContacts - Return only contacts

- inputMessagesFilterPinned - Returns only pinned messages, used for implementing the pinned message list

The returned messages.Messages constructors contain parameters for pagination, the messages themselves and two offset_id_offset/count parameters that can be used to display a progress/total counter like photo 134 of 200.
For example, when displaying the chat photo gallery, we could display a photo ${offset_id_offset} of ${count} indicator on top.

#### Search counters

Chat counters with filters can also be returned without fetching the actual messages, as seen in the schema above.
